# Stock-Price-Predection

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict stock prices, focusing on forecasting future stock prices based on historical data. Accurate stock price prediction is a challenging but highly valuable application of machine learning, aiming to assist investors in making informed decisions.

Objective:
The goal of this project was to build a predictive model that forecasts stock prices using historical stock data. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the project sought to uncover patterns and trends that could help predict future stock movements.

Approach:
Data Collection and Preparation:

Data Source: Obtained historical stock price data from [data source, e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, etc.].
Features: Included various features such as open price, high price, low price, closing price, volume, and potentially additional features like technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI).
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, outliers, and ensured the data was properly formatted and normalized.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted EDA to understand the stock price trends and correlations between different features.
Visualized the historical stock prices and their trends over time using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Feature Engineering:

Created additional features if necessary, such as lagged variables (previous days' prices) and rolling statistics (moving averages).
Scaled and transformed features to improve model performance.
Model Development:

Implemented various machine learning algorithms to predict stock prices, including:
Linear Regression: To establish a baseline model for predicting stock prices.
Time Series Models: Such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) for capturing temporal dependencies.
Advanced Models: Such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for capturing complex temporal patterns in sequential data.
Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Model Evaluation:

Assessed the performance of the models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Conducted backtesting to validate the modelâ€™s predictions against historical data.
Results and Insights:

Analyzed the results to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of each model.
Discussed findings and insights gained from the predictions, including potential improvements and adjustments.
Visualization:

Created visualizations to compare predicted stock prices against actual historical prices.
Used charts and graphs to illustrate model performance and prediction accuracy.
Tools and Libraries Used:
Python: The programming language used for data analysis and model development.
Libraries:
Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy for numerical operations.
scikit-learn for implementing machine learning models.
Keras/TensorFlow for developing and training LSTM networks.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning techniques for predicting stock prices, showcasing the potential of these methods to inform financial decisions. It highlights the importance of feature engineering, model evaluation, and backtesting in developing robust predictive models.
